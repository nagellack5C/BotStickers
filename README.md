# BotStickers
TL;DR: A simple Telegram bot that fetches random sticker from a web sticker shop (using SQLite). Also includes parsing functionality for the website (via Selenium).

ParazitaKusok is a company that sells stickers. (Check them out, they're awesome). I decided that it would be cool to both practice Python and create something cool for these guys. So, meet the Telegram bot!
Parser functionality gets all stickers from the given category using Selenium and stores them in a local database.
Telegram bot can fetch random sticker from the database and let user rate it.
It is absolutely WIP now but you can check it out anyway (if my PC is on and the bot is running): https://telegram.me/ParazitaBot
I've backed up the DB so feel free to play.
